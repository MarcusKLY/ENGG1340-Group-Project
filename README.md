## Storyline
You are an ordinary HKU student. As an HKU student, it is normal to have a lot of homework to complete. One day, you were stuck in the KKL building and fell asleep while working on a deadline for the next day.

You need to go home immediately or you will be scolded by your family. However, you notice that it's weird, there's no light source, and you can't find anyone to help.

As you look for your way out of HKU, you encounter many obstacles to overcome, and then you slowly discover that the whole thing behind it is much more serious than you thought.

Do your best to get through all the challenges, learn the story behind this event, and get out of the place!
