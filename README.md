As a typical HKU student, you're stuck in the KKL building late at night, struggling to meet a deadline. You jolted awake to find yourself lost in a dark maze and completely alone. Your mission is to escape HKU by overcoming obstacles and unraveling a sinister conspiracy. Can you unleash your inner strength and conquer the challenges that lie ahead to uncover the truth?


## Gameplay
In this text-based game, players use their keyboard and mouse to control their character, making different decisions that influence the outcome and progression of the story.


## Combat
A turn-based battle game, player can choose actions of punch, kick, block, dodge and use items. Different actions has its advantage and disadvantage against different opponent action. Consider what action opponent will take and choose the suitable action to win the battle. Moreover, various games will be implemented such as tic-tac-toe and wordle, where the players could battle with the program.

## Coding Features

### 1. Generation of random game sets or events
- In battle, attack damage(p_atk,e_atk) is random integer within a range, enemy have random action(e_action) and random dialogue with player in each round.
-
### 2. Data structures for storing game status

- Inside the `PlayerInfo`, player specific information will be stored, including:
  - `user_name`, in form of string
  - `difficulty`, in form of string
  - `hp`(Health Point), in form of integer
  - `buff`, in form of integer
  - `items`, in form of string vector
  - `checkpoint`, in form of string
  
 - Inside `ColorOption`, word colors are being stored

- In battle, int is used to store player and enemy hp, and array of int is used to store remain numbers of rounds of special effect players have.

### 3. Dynamic memory management

- In battle, a dynamic int array with changing size is used to store id of items player have in each round

### 4. File input/output

- Game data are stored in the `saves.sav` file for player to save and load game saves. Those files could also be delete in the game menu.
- The wordle's predefined words are stored in `answer.txt`, and loaded during the game.
  
### 5. Program codes in multiple files

- DIfferent function are in multiple files (some examples below)
  - `PlayerInfo` and `ColorOption` struct,  will be declared and defined in its own header and source files, which could be used in all other sourse file.
  - Different word output styles in `output_style.h` could be used repeatedly.
  - From main game can call function `call_new_battle` in `battle.h` to start a new battle
